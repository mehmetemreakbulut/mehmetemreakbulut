- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Emre Akbulut, 3rd grade Computer Engineering student in Bogazici University, Turkey. Over the last few years, I have been part of many startups with different teams. In some of them, I worked as a developer and as a project manager. ID Istanbul and Eventmate are my projects that I am both a founder and a developer. Especially ID Istanbul has already started to take its place in the Istanbul event world with its team of 10 people. TalkOnlineDoc, which I have been a part of since its establishment as Project Manager, is on its way to becoming one of the new generation health platforms that has started to make a name for itself in Turkey. Besides, I did internships at companies such as TechSign Istanbul and P2P Software (Frankfurt). 
I have been in various clubs in my university life, but especially IEEE Bogazici is very important to me. This club and IEEE have had a huge impact on me, where I've experienced everything from membership to vice president. We also organized events that received awards from IEEE on a global scale, especially with IEEE. My university life is going pretty well amid all this busyness. Since I am a regular person, I learn my lessons successfully and with interest.
I want to continue my life in a business environment shaped by new technologies and startups. In this direction, young startups that are in search of new technologies instead of corporate companies and that bring different ideas to the fore will always attract my attention. It is among my priorities that the companies I apply to be open to innovation.
